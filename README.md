Linux Show Player (LiSP) - Sound player designed for stage productions

---

Every component on which LiSP relies (python3, GStreamer and Qt5) is multi-platform, but the program is currently tested and developed only for **GNU/Linux**.

No special hardware is required to run LiSP, but some processing operations would surely take benefit from a recent CPU.

For bugs/requests an issue can be open on the GitHub issues-tracker, for everything else [gitter](https://gitter.im/linux-show-player/linux-show-player) can be used.

### Installation

#### AppImage

You can download an [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) bundle of LiSP from the release page, once downloaded make the file executable.
Now you should be able to run LiSP by double-clicking the file.
