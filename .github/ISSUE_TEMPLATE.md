Before posting an issue:
 - avoid opening a new issue if you need a simple or a yes/no answer, use gitter instead
 - check if the same issue is already been reported

When writing an issue:
 - use the markdown formatting to make the issue easier to read
 - don't worry about being sarcastic ;-)
 - for bugs/unexpected behavior, use the following "template"
 - remove the template text you don't need, like these first 9 lines
